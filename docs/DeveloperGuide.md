VitaBook is designed with four main components:

- **[UI Component](#ui-component)** – Handles user interface rendering and interaction using JavaFX.
- **[Logic Component](#logic-component)** – Parses and executes user commands via a central command parser.
- **[Model Component](#model-component)** – Maintains the in-memory state of the application, including the patient list.
- **[Storage Component](#storage-component)** – Reads from and writes to JSON files to persist user data.

In addition, the [Common Classes](#common-classes) section documents utility classes shared across multiple packages.

> **Note:** All diagrams in this section (e.g., architecture, class, sequence diagrams) are generated using PlantUML.
> The corresponding `.puml` source files are located in the `diagrams` folder of this project.
> You can refer to the [SE-EDU PlantUML Tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) if you wish to modify or create new diagrams for future enhancements.


### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

1. Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
2. Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
3. Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
4. Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>


The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.


<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

1. When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
2. All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.



### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />


The `Model` component:

1. Stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
2. Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
3. Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
4. Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Allergy` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Allergy` object per unique allergy, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Allergy` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:
1. can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
2. inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
3. depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command Implementation
<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="AddCommand Class Diagram"/>

The `AddCommand` allows the user to register a new patient by specifying all the required fields such as name, gender, contact details, dietary needs, and medical priorities. This command ensures that each patient added is unique based on the email field.

#### Key Code Snippets

- Command Execution (Checks for duplicates before adding):
```
@Override
public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
    requireNonNull(model);
    if (model.hasPerson(toAdd)) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON);
    }
    model.addPerson(toAdd);
    return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, Messages.format(toAdd)));
}
```

- Example Usage:
```add n/John Doe g/m h/1.75 w/70 p/98765432 e/john@example.com a/123 Street d/vegan pr/high m/2025-12-31 al/peanuts```

#### Developer Notes

- Validation: The Person constructor validates fields (e.g., Email format, Height range).
- Duplicate person criteria: If the email entered already exists in VitaBook, the person will be considered a duplicate. This is because in our unique context, the nutritionist uses the email to primarily contact the patient and send sensitive documents.
- Case Sensitivity: Allergies (al/) are case-insensitive (stored in lowercase).

When a user issues a command such as `add n/John d/vegan`(simplified for this example, this command does not actually run in VitaBook), the following sequence of operations occurs:

1. The input is parsed by `AddCommandParser`, which creates a `Person` object and wraps it inside an `AddCommand`.
2. The `LogicManager` executes the command by calling its `execute(Model model)` method.
3. Inside `AddCommand#execute()`, the `Model` is checked for any duplicate entries using `hasPerson()`.
4. If no duplicates are found, the new `Person` is added to the address book via `model.addPerson()`.
5. A `CommandResult` is returned with a success message.

The following sequence diagram outlines the flow of the AddCommand:

<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddCommand Sequence Diagram"/>


---
### Edit Command Implementation

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="EditCommand Class Diagram"/>

The `EditCommand` allows users to update one or more fields of an existing patient in the list. Fields that are not specified in the command remain unchanged.

#### Key Components

- `EditPersonDescriptor`: A helper class to track which fields are modified.
- Partial Updates: Only updates non-null fields in the descriptor.

#### Key Code Snippets
- Creating an Edited Person (merges old and new fields)
```
private static Person createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit, EditPersonDescriptor descriptor) {
    Name updatedName = descriptor.getName().orElse(personToEdit.getName());
    Phone updatedPhone = descriptor.getPhone().orElse(personToEdit.getPhone());
    // ... (other fields)
    return new Person(updatedName, updatedPhone, ...);
}
```
- Example Usage:
``` edit 1 p/91234567 e/new@example.com ```


#### Developer Notes

- Immutable Objects: Person is immutable; edits create a new object.
- Index Handling: Uses Index class to validate list bounds.

When a user issues a command such as `edit 1 e/john@example.com`, the following steps take place:

1. The command is parsed by `EditCommandParser`, which produces an `EditCommand` with an index and an `EditPersonDescriptor`.
2. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `EditCommand`.
3. Inside `EditCommand#execute()`, the selected patient is fetched from the filtered list using the index.
4. A new `Person` is created by merging the original details with the updated fields from `EditPersonDescriptor`.
5. If the new `Person` is not a duplicate, `model.setPerson()` replaces the original person.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned indicating the successful update.

The sequence diagram below depicts the interaction of components involved:

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditCommand Sequence Diagram"/>


### Clear Command Implementation

<puml src="diagrams/ClearCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="ClearCommand Class Diagram"/>

The `ClearCommand` removes all patient entries from the address book. To prevent accidental deletions, a confirmation dialog is shown (unless bypassed in test scenarios).

#### Key Code Snippets
- Confirmation Dialog (UI interaction)
```
if (!requireConfirmation || ClearDialogUtil.showConfirmationDialog(...)) {
    model.setAddressBook(new AddressBook());
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
```
- Example Usage: `clear`

#### Developer Notes
- Safety Net: Confirmation is skipped in tests (`requireConfirmation = false`).
- Empty Check: Early return if the address book is already empty.

When the user enters `clear`, the command follows this sequence:

1. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `ClearCommand`.
2. If the address book is already empty, a message is returned immediately.
3. If confirmation is required, the UI invokes `ClearDialogUtil.showConfirmationDialog()`.
4. Upon confirmation, a new, empty `AddressBook` replaces the current one via `model.setAddressBook()`.
5. A `CommandResult` with a success message is returned.

The process is visualized in the following sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ClearCommand Sequence Diagram"/>


### Priority Command Implementation

<puml src="diagrams/priority-command/PriorityCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="PriorityCommand Class Diagram"/>

The `PriorityCommand` allows the nutritionist to update the priority level (e.g., HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) of a selected patient from the filtered list. This command is helpful in identifying high-risk patients for urgent follow-up.

#### Key Command Implementation
- Updating Priority
```
Person updatedPerson = new Person(
    originalPerson.getName(),
    originalPerson.getGender(),
    // ... (other fields)
    newPriority,  // Updated field
    originalPerson.getMeetingDate(),
    originalPerson.getAllergies()
);
```
- Example usage: `priority 2 pr/high`

#### Developer Notes
- Shortcut: pr/ can be used instead of priority.

When a user issues a command such as `priority 2 pr/HIGH`, the following sequence of operations occurs:

1. The input is parsed by `PriorityCommandParser`, which creates a `PriorityCommand` object.
2. The `LogicManager` receives the command and calls its `execute(Model model)` method.
3. Inside `PriorityCommand#execute()`, the `Model` is queried for the current filtered list of persons.
4. The patient at the specified index is retrieved and a new `Person` object is created with the updated `Priority`.
5. The `Model#setPerson()` method replaces the original person with the updated one in the internal list.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned with a success message.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the components when executing the priority command:

<puml src="diagrams/priority-command/PriorityCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="PriorityCommand Sequence Diagram"/>


### Sort Command Implementation

The sequence below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("sort priority")` call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort priority` Command" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.
</box>

#### Key Code Snippets
- Comparator Logic (Priority-first, then name):
```
Comparator<Person> comparator = Comparator
    .comparing((Person p) -> p.getPriority().getValue().ordinal()).reversed()
    .thenComparing(p -> p.getName().toString().toLowerCase());
```
- Example usage: `sort priority`


#### Developer Notes
- Extensibility: New sort criteria can be added by extending the switch block.

`SortCommand` behaviour:

1. When the `LogicManager` is called to execute the `sort priority` command, it first delegates the parsing to `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` recognises the command type and uses `SortCommandParser` to interpret the command arguments.
3. `SortCommandParser` creates a new  `SortCommand` object with the given sort type (`priority`).
4. The constructed `SortCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`, which then calls its `execute()` method.
5. Within `execute()`, `SortCommand` invoked `model.sortFilteredPersonList(comparator)` to sort the current patient list based on the specified criterion.
6. A `CommandResult` object is created to encapsulate the success message and is returned up the call stack to the UI.


### Filter Command Implementation

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("filter d/low fat")` call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `filter d/low fat` Command" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for FilterCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.

</box>

#### Key Code Snippets
- Predicate Construction (Dynamic filtering):
```
Predicate<Person> filterPredicate = switch (prefix) {
    case "d" -> person -> person.getDiet().toString().equalsIgnoreCase(value);
    case "g" -> person -> person.getGender().toString().equalsIgnoreCase(value);
    // ... (other cases)
};
```
- Example usage: `filter d/vegan`

#### Developer Notes
- Case Insensitivity: Filters are case-insensitive (e.g., d/vegan matches Vegan).

`FilterCommand` behaviour:

1. When the `LogicManager` receives the `filter d/low fat` command, it calls `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
2. `AddressBookParser` recognises that it is a `filter` command and passes control to `FilterCommandParser`.
3. `FilterCommandParser` splits the input into the prefix (`d`) and the value (`low fat`), then constructs a `FilterCommand` object with the parsed arguments.
4. The `FilterCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which proceeds to execute it.
5. The `FilterCommand` builds a predicate using the prefix and value, and applies it through `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
6. A `CommandResult` containing the result message is returned to the `LogicManager`, and subsequently to the UI.


### Command History Implementation

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction flow when a user enters commands and navigates through command history

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Command History Sequence Diagram" />

The CommandHistory class tracks all executed commands, allowing users to navigate through past commands using UP/DOWN arrow keys. It maintains:
- A list of commands (commandHistory).
- A pointer (currentIndex) to track navigation position.

#### Key Code Snippets
- Storing Commands:
```
public void addCommand(String command) {
    commandHistory.add(command);
    currentIndex = commandHistory.size(); // Reset pointer to end
}
```
- Navigation:
```
public String getPreviousCommand() {
    if (currentIndex <= 0) return null;
    currentIndex--;
    return commandHistory.get(currentIndex);
}

public String getNextCommand() {
    if (currentIndex >= commandHistory.size() - 1) return null;
    currentIndex++;
    return commandHistory.get(currentIndex);
}
```

#### Developer Notes
- Pointer Reset: currentIndex resets to the end after each new command.
- Null Handling: Returns null when reaching history bounds (no-op in UI).
- Thread Safety: Not thread-safe; assumes single-threaded UI access.

`CommandHistory` behaviour:

1. **User Interaction**: The user inputs commands through the `CommandBox` in the UI, which are captured and processed by the system.
2. **Logic Processing**: The `LogicManager` processes these commands using the `AddressBookParser` to identify and execute the appropriate command, interacting with the `Model` as needed.
3. **Command History**: Each executed command is recorded in `CommandHistory`, allowing users to navigate through past commands using the UP and DOWN arrow keys. This navigation updates the command input field, facilitating easy re-execution or modification of previous commands.


### Undo/redo Command Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.

#### Key Code Snippets
- State Management (VersionedAddressBook):
```
public void commit() {
    // Purge future states if pointer is not at end
    addressBookStateList.subList(currentStatePointer + 1, addressBookStateList.size()).clear();
    addressBookStateList.add(new AddressBook(this));
    currentStatePointer++;
}
```
- Undo/Redo Execution:
```
// UndoCommand.java
public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
    if (!model.canUndoAddressBook()) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
    }
    model.undoAddressBook();
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}

// RedoCommand.java (similar logic)
```
#### Developer Notes
- Immutable States: Each snapshot is a deep copy of AddressBook.
- Non-Modifying Commands: list, find, sort, help do not trigger commits.
- UI Sync: The UI refreshes automatically after undo/redo via Model observers.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

* **State Purge:** Executing a new command after an undo will purge the redo history. Only relevant states are restorable.

## Glossary

### Core Concepts
| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Example/Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Patient**        | An individual under nutritional care with stored health/dietary data.      | Created via `add n/John Doe d/vegan`                                        |
| **Nutritionist**   | Healthcare professional managing patient diets via VitaBook.               | Primary user of the application.                                            |
| **CLI**            | Command-Line Interface for text-based commands.                            | Faster than GUI (e.g., `edit 1 p/98765432` updates phone number).           |
| **GUI**            | Graphical User Interface (minimal use in VitaBook).                        | Only displays results (e.g., patient lists).                                |

### Technical Terms
| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Example/Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JAR File**       | Executable Java package containing all dependencies.                       | Run VitaBook via `java -jar vitabook.jar`                                   |
| **JSON**           | Data storage format for patient records.                                   | Human-editable file at `./data/patients.json`                               |
| **Mainstream OS**  | Supported operating systems.                                               | Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)                              |

### Medical/Dietary Terms
| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Example/Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Diet**           | Prescribed food regimen (e.g., vegan, keto).                               | Filter via `filter d/keto`                                                  |
| **Priority**       | Follow-up urgency level (`high`/`medium`/`low`).                           | Set via `priority 1 pr/high`                                                |
| **Allergy**        | Food sensitivity requiring dietary exclusion.                              | Tracked via `add ... al/peanuts`                                            |

### Command Syntax
| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Example/Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prefix**         | Shortcode before input values (e.g., `n/` for name).                      | `add n/Alice p/12345678` → `n/` and `p/` are prefixes.                      |
| **Modifying Cmd**  | Commands that change data (tracked in undo history).                       | `add`, `delete`, `edit`                                                     |
| **Non-Modifying Cmd** | Read-only commands (excluded from undo history).                        | `list`, `find`, `help`                                                      |

### Key Features
| Term               | Definition                                                                 | Example/Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auto-save**      | Automatic data persistence after changes.                                  | Saves to JSON after `add`/`edit`/`delete`.                                  |
| **Portability**    | Runs anywhere with Java 17 (no installation).                              | Single JAR file deployment.                                                 |
| **Case-Insensitive** | Commands/filters ignore letter case.                                    | `FILTER D/KETO` works same as `filter d/keto`                               |

### **Exploratory Testing Tips**
1. **Combination Testing**:
    - Chain commands (e.g., `add` → `edit` → `undo` → `filter`).
2. **Data Limits**:
    - Test with 1000+ patients for performance.
3. **Localization**:
    - Non-English names (e.g., `add n/李华`).

**Critical**: Always back up `data/patients.json` before testing destructive commands (`clear`, `delete`).
