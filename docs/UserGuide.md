### 1.3 Quick start 🚀

Let us guide you through your start with VitaBook:

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br>
   **Check/Install Java:** See [Java Setup Instructions](#7-java-setup-instructions-2) at the bottom of this guide.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases)!

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your own VitaBook.

4. Open a command terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file.

5. Type the command `java -jar vitabook.jar` to run the application. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data.<br>

<a href="images/Ui.png">

<img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; display: block;"/>
</a>

*Figure 1: The VitaBook UI, showing layout and sample data*<br>

6. Try typing the command in the command box and press *Enter* to execute it.<br>
   e.g. typing `help` and pressing *Enter* will open the help window. Let's try some out!:

<p style="padding-left: 20px">

* `list` : Lists all patients.

* `add n/John Doe g/m h/1.78 w/70.00 no/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123, #01-01 d/low sodium m/2025-01-25 pr/LOW` : Adds a new patient named `John Doe` to your VitaBook.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient in the current list.

* `clear` : Deletes all patients.

* `exit` : Exits the app.
</p>

7. Were these commands fun to play with? Feel free to explore further the functionalities of VitaBook by following [Features](#2-features-2)!

### 1.4 Instructions about Commands 🧾

These are a few things to take note while exploring VitaBook!

1. Command keywords are **case-sensitive**.<br>
   e.g. `delete 1` is a known command, while `Delete 1` is an unknown command.


2. Words that are in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the nutritionist, you!<br>
   e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which you can fill in as `add n/John Doe`.


3. Items in square brackets are **optional**.<br>
   e.g `n/NAME [al/ALLERGY]` mean you can either have allergy or not such as `n/John Doe al/fish` or as `n/John Doe`. After all, not everybody has allergies, do they?


4. Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
   e.g. `[al/ALLERGY]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `al/milk`, `al/milk al/peanut` etc. This makes your entry of each patient more comprehensive!


5. Parameters for `add` and `edit` commands can be in any order.<br>
   e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME no/PHONE`, `no/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable, making the system flexible.


6. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (i.e. `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo`, `redo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
   e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help` so as to make your experience convenient!


7. If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

---

**❓ Q: How is VitaBook different from a regular address book?**

---

---

**💬 A:** No worries — just use the `undo` command to bring them back. VitaBook remembers your recent changes so you don’t have to stress.

## 4. Known Issues 🐞

- **Allergy fields are case-sensitive.**
  Adding allergies like `peanuts` and `Peanuts` results in two different allergies being stored. This can lead to duplicates or confusion when filtering/searching.

- **Allergy Validation is only alphanumeric.**
  User can enter any combination of letters and numbers, even if they don't represent actual allergies. This is because maintaining a complete list of all possible allergies is not feasible.

- **No support for recurring meeting dates or reminders.**
  Only a single meeting date can be stored per patient, with no repeat scheduling or notification support.

- **Commands must follow strict prefixes.**
  Forgetting a prefix (like `n/` for the name field) will result in an invalid command, even if the content is correct.

- **No concurrency or multi-user support.**
  VitaBook is designed as a single-user desktop application. Running two instances may cause file conflicts or data loss.

- **No graphical support for charts or health analytics.**
  Patient data is presented in text format only. Features like BMI calculation, graphs, or dashboards are not supported.

- **Application crashes if `vitabook.json` is manually corrupted.**
  If the user edits or corrupts the storage file manually, VitaBook may fail to start or load a blank state. To solve this issue, try deleting `vitabook.json` and rerunning the application. Remember to backup the file before deleting.

## 6. Glossary 🧾

### Software Terms

**Java 17**
The 17th version of the Java programming language and runtime environment.
Java 17 provides the libraries and tools necessary to run Java applications—such as VitaBook.

**JDK (Java Development Kit)**
A complete software development package that includes the Java runtime, compilers, and various tools to develop and run Java applications. Vitabook requires JDK 17 or later. Make sure you install the correct version to ensure compatibility.

**Terminal / Command Line Interface (CLI)**
A text-based interface used to interact with your computer’s operating system. In the terminal, you can navigate between folders and execute commands. To run Vitabook, open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows), use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the `vitabook.jar` file, and then type:
```
java -jar vitabook.jar
```

### Patient Information Terms 🩺

**Priority**  
Your way of deciding **how urgent a patient's needs are**. Higher priority = more attention needed.

**Diet**  
The **nutrition plan** you've prescribed for a patient — like “low sodium”, “high protein”, or “vegetarian”.

**Allergy**  
Any food or substance the patient should avoid — this helps you keep their plan safe and accurate.

**Remark**  
A free space to jot down helpful notes — appointment preferences, progress, reminders, anything you’d write in a physical notebook.

**Meeting Date**  
The patient’s upcoming appointment (or last one, if you're keeping records).  
Great for staying on top of your schedule.

**Gender / Height / Weight**  
Basic health data to help you understand and track your patient’s profile.

**Index**  
The number next to each patient when you view the list — you’ll use it when editing, prioritising, or deleting someone.
