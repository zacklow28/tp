### 1.3 Quick start üöÄ

Let us guide you through your start with VitaBook:

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br>
   **Check/Install Java:** See [Java Setup Instructions](#java-setup-instructions) at the bottom of this guide.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases)!

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your own VitaBook.

4. Open a command terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the `.jar` file.

5. Type the command `java -jar vitabook.jar` to run the application. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data.<br>

<a href="images/Ui.png">

<img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="width: 100%; max-width: 700px; display: block;"/>
</a>

*Figure 1: The VitaBook UI, showing layout and sample data*<br>

6. Try typing the command in the command box and press *Enter* to execute it.<br>
   e.g. typing `help` and pressing *Enter* will open the help window. Let's try some out!:

<p style="padding-left: 20px">

* `list` : Lists all patients.

* `add n/John Doe g/m h/1.78 w/70 no/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123, #01-01 d/low sodium m/2025-01-25 pr/LOW` : Adds a new patient named `John Doe` to your VitaBook.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient in the current list.

* `clear` : Deletes all patients.

* `exit` : Exits the app.
</p>

7. Were these commands fun to play with? Feel free to explore further the functionalities of VitaBook by following [Features](#2-features)!

### 1.4 Instructions about Commands üßæ

These are a few things to take note while exploring VitaBook!

1. Command keywords are **case-sensitive**.<br>
   e.g. `delete 1` is a known command, while `Delete 1` is an unknown command.


2. Words that are in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the nutritionist, you!<br>
   e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which you can fill in as `add n/John Doe`.


3. Items in square brackets are **optional**.<br>
   e.g `n/NAME [al/ALLERGY]` mean you can either have allergy or not such as `n/John Doe al/fish` or as `n/John Doe`. After all, not everybody has allergies, do they?


4. Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
   e.g. `[al/ALLERGY]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `al/milk`, `al/milk al/peanut` etc. This makes your entry of each patient more comprehensive!


5. Parameters for `add` and `edit` commands can be in any order.<br>
   e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME no/PHONE`, `no/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable, making the system flexible.


6. Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (i.e. `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo`, `redo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
   e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help` so as to make your experience convenient!


7. If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## 4. Known Issues üêû

- **Allergy fields are case-sensitive.**
  Adding allergies like `peanuts` and `Peanuts` results in two different allergies being stored. This can lead to duplicates or confusion when filtering/searching.

- **Allergy Validation is only alphanumeric.**
  User can enter any combination of letters and numbers, even if they don't represent actual allergies. This is because maintaining a complete list of all possible allergies is not feasible.

- **No support for recurring meeting dates or reminders.**
  Only a single meeting date can be stored per patient, with no repeat scheduling or notification support.

- **Commands must follow strict prefixes.**
  Forgetting a prefix (like `n/` for the name field) will result in an invalid command, even if the content is correct.

- **No concurrency or multi-user support.**
  VitaBook is designed as a single-user desktop application. Running two instances may cause file conflicts or data loss.

- **No graphical support for charts or health analytics.**
  Patient data is presented in text format only. Features like BMI calculation, graphs, or dashboards are not supported.

- **Application crashes if `vitabook.json` is manually corrupted.**
  If the user edits or corrupts the storage file manually, VitaBook may fail to start or load a blank state. To solve this issue, try deleting `vitabook.json` and rerunning the application. Remember to backup the file before deleting.
